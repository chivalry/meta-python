Testing
=======

Automated testing is an enormous topic. In this chapter we're not going to deal with it in a manner anywhere approaching exhaustive. Instead, we're going to show you how to integrate testing with your package by creating a few test suites. These tests can be used yourself and specified in your package definition so that others can easily use them as well.
